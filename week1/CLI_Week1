1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

1.1 touch . index.html 

2.2 mkdir . css

3.3 ls -a


2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

 mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

 touch homework.txt
 echo "first message" > homework.txt
 echo "second message" >> homework.txt
